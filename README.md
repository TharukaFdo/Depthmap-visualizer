The EXR Depth Visualizer was created to help interpret and validate depth information stored in .exr files, particularly those generated by AI-based depth estimation models or 3D engines like Unity. It allows for precise visualization of float32 R, G, B channels and combined views, making it easier to debug, analyze, and prepare depth data for use in VR transformation frameworks, stereo vision systems, or scientific research workflows.
colab and local executables are provided for single and multi exr import
